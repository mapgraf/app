JS files in this folder are glue code generated by the JCO transpiler, which uses [bytecodealliance/preview2-shim](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) â€” a WASI Preview2 implementation for Node.js and browsers.


The linked WASM components are compiled for the WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) target, meaning they run in a strictly sandboxed environment without direct access to browser globals like `window` or `document`.

Unlike traditional Wasm modules, the Wasm Components model enforces strict interface boundaries, allowing interaction with the outside environment only through well-defined interfaces.

As a result, these components **cannot access or manipulate the DOM or interact with the JavaScript environment** in the browser.
